scalabcn-site
=============

Source code for the UG site. This was first created during the Scaladays Hack Weekend organized by the Scala User Group - Berlin Brandenburg (http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/events/182906492/).

This is work in progress, please check issues section if you want to help or have suggestions on improvements.


Running the code
================

You'll need several ENV_VAR's to run the application. Please review env.sh.sample

        $ cat env.sh.sample

Copy the env.sh.sample to env.sh and type in your keys.

        $ cp env.sh.sample env.sh ; vi env.sh

Finally run the env.sh and start play on that same terminal:

        $ ./env.sh ; play 


Running on Heroku
=================

Get the code pushed to your heroku app and ensure all ENV vars are set.
